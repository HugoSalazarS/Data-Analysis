# Data Cleaning, Insights Discovery, and Visualization Project

This project is a process of data cleaning, insights discovery, and visualization made from two datasets with user information. The datasets are from users who signed up for a talent recruiter platform.

## Installation

Before starting, ensure that port 8888 is free on your local machine; otherwise, change it in the `docker-compose.yml` file. To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
2. Run `docker-compose up --build` to build the Docker container and start the Jupyter Notebook server.
3. Copy the URL given by the terminal into a browser.
4. If the token is required, it is likely listed in the terminal.
5. We strongly recommend opening the URL in Firefox.

Once you have completed these steps, you should be able to access the Jupyter Notebook server in your browser and start exploring the datasets.
